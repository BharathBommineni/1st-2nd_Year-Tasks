Firstly I've always been intrigued by the concpt of blockchain although I have no idea of its working, 've also heard my peers and many people dicuss that the area of blockchain is a future proof domain which I can  rely on. Apart from the career point of view I am particularly interested in the working of crypto and blockchain technologies. Now I am interested in joining the Amrita Blockchain club cause I feel here I can get a pressure free envirnoment to learn and develop my skill set and have the necessary tech stack and qualifications to bag a job in the blockchain industry, my primary goal and expectations from this club is a good career and internship oppurtunities but I would also love to contribute top any research programs or projects to help my seniors and juniors in the future.
